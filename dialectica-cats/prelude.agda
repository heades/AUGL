-- Extensionality will be used when proving equivalences of morphisms.
postulate ext-set : ∀{l1 l2 : level} → extensionality {l1} {l2}
-- These are isomorphisms, but Agda has no way to prove these as
-- equivalences.  They are consistent to adopt as equivalences by
-- univalence:
postulate ∧-unit : ∀{ℓ}{A : Set ℓ} → A ≡ (⊤ {ℓ} ∧ A)
postulate ∧-assoc : ∀{ℓ}{A B C : Set ℓ} →  (A ∧ (B ∧ C)) ≡ ((A ∧ B) ∧ C)
postulate ∧-twist : ∀{ℓ}{A B : Set ℓ} →  (A ∧ B) ≡ (B ∧ A)
-- Provable from the above axioms:
postulate assoc-twist₁ : {A B C D : Set} → ((A × C) × (B × D)) ≡ ((A × B) × (C × D))

-- The following defines a commutative monoid as lists:
_* = 𝕃

postulate *-comm : ∀{A : Set}{l₁ l₂ : A *} → l₁ ++ l₂ ≡ l₂ ++ l₁
